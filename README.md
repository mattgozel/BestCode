# BestCode
The best code I've written (so far)!
I'm using this repository to showcase the best coding I've done so far. If you want to get a sense of what I can do, start here!
GuildCars is a full stack web application I created from scratch. Files include the DB creation scripts.
FlooringMasteryRefactored is a basic CRUD web application. It is scalable and reusable.
